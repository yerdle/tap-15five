#### Cron jobs usually vary by environment 
#### Create a sub-element of 'cron_settings' per cron job
####  Month with day-of-month is available as well if needed (contact DevOps)

cron_settings: {}
# The above is an empty dictionary. To add an entry, delete the '{}'. Example:
#
#cron_settings:
#  tap-15five:
#    name:      "Tap 15Five"
#    minute:    "30"
#    hour:      "23"
#    weekday:   "*"
#    job_cmd:   "~/.virtualenvs/tap-15five/bin/tap-15five"
