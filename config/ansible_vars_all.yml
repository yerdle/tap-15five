####### Variables common to all environments

#### Templates are a resource that spans the environments.
#### Ansible replaces the jinja variables and places the result in /etc/opt/<repo>/
####
# Start with a simple list. If different settings for different templates 
# are needed, we can change it to a dictionary

dw_etl_templates:
    - tap_15five_config.json
    - target_stitch_config.json
